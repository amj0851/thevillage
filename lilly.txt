Im LILLY and my favorite animal is a BEETLE. Do you know leo?//he's my bestfriend. We go exploring together.//he's cool. I'm cooler.
Do you like beetles?//okay good, we can be friends.//well they don't like you either. and I dont like you now.
Have you been over by that creepy tower? I heard you asking my dad about it// I wanna know what's inside!!//Oh, so youre scared? Coward!
Footprints by the tower?..would you believe me if I said it wasnt me?//Gullible.//yeah...Leo and I were playing hide and seek over there. Don't tell anyone or we'd get in trouble!

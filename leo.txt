rawr! rawrawrawrawrwrawr?//rawr! RAWR rawr, rawr!!// oh okay well I'm busy looking for beetles right now
I live with woofy. He's nice on the inside I promise but....can you keep a secret?//I hear Woof growling at night...I think he has nightmares//then I dont want to talk to you! Leave me alone
Did you find out what was bothering Woof? Was it nightmares?//...I don't think we should talk about the tower//weird...
Woofy told me you're a liar. I don't wanna talk to you.
I saw you talking to Lilly..are you here to ask about the tower?//We were just playing hide & seek, but I found this weird rock//oh good I dont know anything about it.

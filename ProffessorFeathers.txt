Greetings! I'm the village historian, Prof. Feathers. Do you want to hear a brief history of our little village?//Well, the earliest record of inhabitants here was in the First Era. They were dinosaurs.
This village was abandoned in the war until the 3rd Era, when a group of herders moved in.
Talk to Tex (the cow) for more information on that, his ancestors were a part of that group. 
That encouraged more villagers of all species to move in, and now the village is what you see before you!//oh..maybe some other time then.
Ah...I expected you would ask me about the tower sooner or later. I must ask you to keep this information secret, can you do that?//Alright. There's only one scroll that mentions the tower directly, although many others reference it. 
It's a child's diary from the Fourth Era, so not everything written should be taken literally, 
,       but it mentions entering the tower and speaking to a witch.     //well, I can hardly tell you confidential information then. Now if you'll excuse me I have manuscripts to translate.
You went inside the tower! Tell me everything!//A witch?...I suppose that scroll was legitimate then. Let me see this letter. oh hm very interesting. I think we should trust her. Please bring her my response.//.....ok....

Well howdy there, I'm Tex. This is my daughter, Lily. Nice weather we're havin' isnt it?//Not a cloud in the sky. Can't get much more perfect than this.//What? You sure haven't worked on a farm if you prefer storms to sun. City Slicker.
What's wrong? did ole Woofy scare you?//Hah! that old dog's bark is worse than his bite. Don't worry 'bout it. Lily and Leo are friends, I know he doesn't mean any harm.//Oh alright.
My ancestors? Well sure I can tell ya what I know. Before us cows came along this dirt wouldn't even grow weeds. Some called it cursed land.//well my ancestors put in the work and now look at it. Beautiful grass//I'll see you around then.
The tower? well now folks around here don't much like talkin' 'bout that tower. Wanna know what I was told?//My Ma told me that her Ma said there was a witch there that would eat the bad kids. Hah! I think she just wanted to scare me.//alright, you take care now.
